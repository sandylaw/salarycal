# salarycal
    Accounting is a science. 
    The calculation of wages and taxation involves many aspects, is complicated, 
    and is not easy to calculate manually, and generally requires a special information system to achieve.
    This script is just a simple tool for calculating salary.
    It does not involve sick leave, marriage leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, business trip, welfare and many other matters.
    It is mainly for writing SHELL scripts, and the calculation results are for entertainment only.
    Suggestions for improvement of the script itself are welcome.
    Do not complain about the accuracy of wages and calculations.

    会计是门科学，工资及税务计算涉及很多方面，
    具有复杂性，手工不易计算，一般需要专门的信息化系统实现。    
    这是个简单计算工资的脚本，不涉及病假、婚假、产假、陪产假、出差、福利等诸多事项。
    主要是为了写SHELL脚本，计算结果仅供娱乐。
    欢迎针对脚本本身提出改进意见。
    请勿吐槽工资本身及计算的准确性。
